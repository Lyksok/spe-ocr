# OCR - Optical Character Recognition for Crossword Puzzles

## About
Developed by the **Organized Chaotic Results** team, a group of four EPITA students from the 2028 graduating class: **Caroline Deliere**, **Fanette Saury**, **Jans Guillop√©**, and **Lise Suzanne**. This project, built during our 3rd semester, is designed to solve crossword grids using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) paired with a neural network for accurate character recognition.


## Prerequisites

To compile and run the application, ensure the following dependencies are installed on your system.

### Required Packages
GCC, pkg-config, SDL2, SDL2_image, and GTK+3
Ubuntu/Debian
```sh
sudo apt install -y gcc pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```
Arch/Manjaro
```sh
sudo pacman -S gcc pkgconf gtk3 sdl2 sdl2_image
```
NixOS
```sh
sudo nix-env -iA nixos.gcc nixos.pkgconfig nixos.gtk3 nixos.SDL2 nixos.SDL2_image
```
## Usage
### GUI
```sh
make
./app_launcher
```
### Solver
```sh
cd source/solver
make
./solver <grid as text> <word>
```
### Neural network
```sh
cd source/neural_network
make
./neural
```
### Detection and segmentation
