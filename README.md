# OCR crosswords
Optical character recognition application to solve crossword puzzles.
## Project constraints
For more details on word search puzzles, one can refer to the following page:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_search.
### Expected features
The application will take as input an image representing a word search grid and output the solved grid.

In its final version, the application will offer a graphical user interface allowing users to load an image in a standard format, view it, correct some of its defects, and finally display the fully completed and solved grid. The solved grid should also be able to be saved.

The application should also have a learning aspect, which may be separated from the main part, allowing users to train the neural network, then save and reload the result of this training.
