output = inputs * weights + bias
The weights are usually initialized randomly while the bias at 0.

ok so the layers are what happens inside the network
the inputs are not a layer !!
have to check whether the outputs are one tho, maybe it's compatible

TODO: find how to train the network (Louis's script can help)
TODO: resize images to a certain size (to determine)
TODO: check wether the transformation from image to list is working correctly
TODO: actually test stuff

/!\ if a function was completely erased or modified
it was moved to old/functions.c
(except maybe if the function was modified little by little)
